NCT03875950,University of Washington,This intervention is a clinician training using standardized patient actors to improve communication and empathy skills of health care workers delivering PrEP to adolescent girls and young women to prevent HIV in Kenya.,,,Clinician training intervention,Quality is assessed as total score from a checklist provided by the SPs after each unannounced visit (n=71 SP visits in each arm) including domains of communication skills and adherence to national guidelines. Communication quality is assessed in an adapted version of the Bayer-Fetzer Kalamazoo Consensus Statement; scores range from 7-28 with higher scores indicating higher quality communication. Guideline adherence is assessed in a scoring system adapted from the Kenyan National AIDS & STI Control Programme guidelines; scores range from 0-13 with higher scores indicating higher PrEP competency. Each measure is computed as a percent of total score possible. The total quality score will be a combined continuous score and rescaled out of 100 per unannounced SP visit. Mean scores among all SP encounters taking place in facilities randomized to the clinical intervention will be compared to mean scores among those randomized to standard of care.
NCT03574129,University of Washington,Clinic level intervention composed of an adolescent transition package with tools to support health care workers to disclose HIV status to adolescents and to track transition to adult care.,Scores are aggregate of total domain scores. Some participants did not respond to all the questions in the score.,An adolescent transition package composed of a disclosure booklet and transition tool,Adolescent Transition Package,"The scale name is the ""Taking Charge transition readiness assessment"". The scale measures readiness to transition to adult care. The scale has questions measuring attainment of knowledge and skills to navigate adult care systems. The scale is divided into 4 domains: HIV literacy (maximum score is 5, minimum 0), self-management (maximum score is 9, minimum 0), communication (maximum score is 5, minimum is 0) and support (maximum score 3, minimum is 0). The higher the score the more prepared an adolescent is to transition to adult care. For this outcome, scores across all domains will be summed to get a total readiness score (maximum score 22, minimum 0)."
